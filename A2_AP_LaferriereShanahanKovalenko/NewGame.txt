You slowly open the door and walk into the office. 
You begin looking through the desk for a master key to escape, when you hear the floor creak behind you.
Before you can turn around, someone - or something - grabs you.
The wolf immediately pounces and attacks the mysterious figure, releasing you from the tight grip.
You turn around to see the figure laying on the ground in a pool of blood.
You notice a master key lying in the blood, so you slowly reach down and grab it.
You make your way down the hallway to the main entrance, and unlock the door.

WOLF
You slowly approach the bush, afraid of what could be hiding within. You carefully pull back some leaves... 
It reveals a wolf. It makes eye contact and begins to growl louder.
You reach out and carefully pet the wolf. It calms down and begins to lick your hand. The wolf seems to be innocent enough.
You decide to take the wolf with you to seek shelter from the rain. You both make your way towards the building...
